# selenium-antiscam
An selenium web automated script to automate mass signup in scam webpage

This script uses python selenium to automate signing up in a scam webpage which tried to scam my friend one day.
It ain't much but it's honest work.

If you are going to run this please use a VPN or proxy, don't serve your IP on a golden plate for them.

You need selenium and python installed to run this script (obviosly)

Bye.
